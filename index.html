    <h4>Pak Army</h4>

       has been heavily involved in combating terrorism and insurgency, particularly in regions like the
       tribal areas along the Afghan border. Through operations like Zarb-e-Azb and Radd-ul-Fasaad, the army
        has played a significant role in stabilizing conflict zones and improving internal security within
         Pakistan.</p>
         <h4>Pak Air Force</h4>
         <p> Pakistan Air Force (PAF) is its JF-17 Thunder multirole combat aircraft, which was developed in
          collaboration with China. The JF-17 is a lightweight, single-engine fighter that serves both
        air-to-air and air-to-ground roles. It's equipped with modern avionics, weapons systems, and has
        the capability to engage in a variety of combat scenarios. This aircraft is a cornerstone ofPakistan's
         defense strategy, providing the Air Force with a balance of affordability and advanced technology.</p>
         <h4>Pak Navy</h4>
         <p> Pakistan Navy is its strong focus on maritime security, especially through the development of its
         submarine force. The Pakistan Navy operates a fleet of submarines, including conventional
        diesel-electric submarines, which are critical for strategic deterrence, coastal defense, and
        intelligence gathering. This capability allows the Pakistan Navy to maintain a strong undersea presence,
         safeguarding the country's coastline and territorial waters.</p>
